Materials for the SQL Alchemy Module 10 challenge for the BCS Data Analytics boot camp

This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook file and a Python .py file with my code answering the questions and queries of the Module 10 challenge.

The code is my own. I got help from Xpert Learning Assistant, particularly for converting dates to datetime format so I could add parameters for the dynamic API start/end date section of the challenge. 
That may not have been part of the assignment but it felt necessary to include.
I specified my own dates for the start and end dates of that section, as shown in the route. However, anyone can change the dates (keeping the same format) and be able to get results.

I also referenced Stack Overflow to confirm my approach and got tutoring help. However class activity files were my primary resource.
